= Asciidoc Splitter

A Java utility to split asciidoc files into a modular documentation layout.
At some point it will also include a way to run this via maven, and possibly gradle, however, at this point in time it is CLI only.

== Building and Running

Build using `./mvnw install -DskipTests` (until it's in a repo). This creates an
uberjar named `asciidoc-splitter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in the `target` directory.

Run as follows:

`java -jar target/asciidoc-splitter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

Specify two options:

`-s` or `--sourceDir`:: Directory that contains the asciidoc files to process.
`-o` or `--outputDir`:: Directory to place the generated files.

NOTE: There is also a `-h` or `--help` if you need a refresher

== Contributing

I'll fill this out a bit more, but I'm going to be doing this all on GitHub.
Please create an issue and send me a pull request.
