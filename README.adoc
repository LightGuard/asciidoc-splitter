= Asciidoc Splitter

A Java utility to split asciidoc files into a modular documentation layout.
At some point it will also include a way to run this via maven, and possibly gradle, however, at this point in time it is CLI only.

== Usage

Build using `mvnw` (until it's in a repo) then run the uberjar in `target` named `asciidoc-splitter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` by using the java command:
`java -jar target/asciidoc-splitter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
You will need to specify two options:

`-s` or `--sourceDir`:: The directory containing the asciidoc files to process.
`-o` or `--outputDir`:: Directory to place the generated files.

NOTE: There is also a `-h` or `--help` if you need a refresher

== Contributing

I'll fill this out a bit more, but I'm going to be doing this all on GitHub.
Please create an issue and send me a pull request.
