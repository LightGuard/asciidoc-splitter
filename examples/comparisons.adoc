= Comparison of standard asciidoc and processed asciidoc

This is a table of comparisons with typical asciidoc syntax and what this utility returns.
You can render this document and verify the two are functionally equivalent by using the asciidoctor command:

[source,shell]
----
asciidoctor comparisons.adoc
----

This will result in an HTML file named `comparisons.html` which you can then inspect at the code level and within a browser for equivalence.
