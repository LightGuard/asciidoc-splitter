== Example applications with {PRODUCT} services

{PRODUCT} includes example applications in the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples[`kogito-examples`] repository in GitHub. These example applications contain various types of {PRODUCT} services on Quarkus or Spring Boot to help you develop your own applications. The services use one or more Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) process models, Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models, Drools Rule Language (DRL) rule units, XLS spreadsheet decision tables, or Java classes to define the service logic.

For information about each example application and instructions for using them, see the `README` file in the relevant application folder.

NOTE: In the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples[`{PRODUCT_INIT}-examples`] repository in GitHub, the example applications in the default `stable` branch use the latest version of {PRODUCT}.

The following list describes some of the examples provided with {PRODUCT}:

* `dmn-quarkus-example` and `dmn-springboot-example`: A decision service (on Quarkus or Spring Boot) that uses DMN to determine driver penalty and suspension based on traffic violations
* `rules-quarkus-helloworld`: A Hello World decision service on Quarkus with a single DRL rule unit
* `ruleunit-quarkus-example` and `ruleunit-springboot-example`: A decision service (on Quarkus or Spring Boot) that uses DRL with rule units to validate a loan application and that exposes REST operations to view application status
* `process-quarkus-helloworld`: A Hello World process service on Quarkus with a single BPMN model
* `process-quarkus-example` and `process-springboot-example`: A process service (on Quarkus or Spring Boot) for ordering items and that exposes REST operations to create new orders or to list and delete active orders
* `onboarding-example`: A combination of a process service and two decision services that use DMN and DRL for onboarding new employees
* `kogito-travel-agency`: A combination of process services and decision services that use DRL and XLS for travel booking, intended for deployment on {OPENSHIFT}

=== Running the {PRODUCT} example applications

To get started quickly with {PRODUCT}, you can run any of the example applications in the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples[`kogito-examples`] repository in GitHub and experiment with the {PRODUCT} services.

For this procedure, use the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-quarkus-example[`process-quarkus-example`] or https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-springboot-example[`process-springboot-example`] application. You can follow similar steps with the other {PRODUCT} examples on Quarkus or Spring Boot.

In the `process-quarkus-example` and `process-springboot-example` applications, the `orders.bpmn2` process describes the steps that need to be followed when ordering items. The process includes a script task for writing debug information and a call activity for invoking a subprocess, using a custom `Order` data object.

.Example `orders.bpmn2` process
image::kogito/creating-running/bpmn-model-example-orders.png[Image of `orders.bpmn` example process]

The `Add items` subprocess invokes the following `orderItems.bpmn2` process, which uses a `CalculationService.calculateTotal` custom Java service and a user task to verify the order.

.Example `orderItems.bpmn2` process invoked as a subprocess
image::kogito/creating-running/bpmn-model-example-order-items.png[Image of `orderItems.bpmn` example process]

The `persons.bpmn2` process invokes a Drools Rule Languge (DRL) rule unit in a business rule task to determine customer age, followed by a user task for special handling requirements for children, if applicable.

.Example `persons.bpmn2` process invoked as a subprocess
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-bpmn-example-person.png[Image of `persons` process diagram]

Based on these processes and on application configurations, this example service exposes REST operations to create new orders, to list and delete active orders, and to determine the age of a specified person.

.Procedure
. Download the latest https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/releases[`kogito-examples`] release to a local directory and extract the file.
. In a command terminal, navigate to the extracted `kogito-examples-__RELEASE__/process-__PLATFORM__-example` folder, and enter one of the following commands to build and run the example.
+
--
Quarkus and Spring Boot support the following run modes:

* *Development mode*: For local testing. On Quarkus, development mode also offers live reload of your processes and decisions in your running applications for advanced debugging.
* *JVM mode*: For compatibility with a Java virtual machine (JVM).
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
* *Native mode*: (Quarkus only, requires GraalVM) For direct binary execution as native code.
endif::[]

The command that you use depends on your preferred run mode and application environment:

* For development mode:

[source]
----
mvn clean package -Dnative
./target/sample-kogito-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
----
+
endif::[]
--
. After the {PRODUCT} service is running, use a REST client, curl utility, or the Swagger UI configured for the application at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/ to send API requests with the following components:
+
--
* *URL*: `\http://localhost:8080/`
* *HTTP headers*:
** `accept`: `application/json`
** `content-type`: `application/json`
* *HTTP methods*: `GET`, `POST`, or `DELETE`

[id='proc-kogito-vscode-extension_{context}']
=== Enabling the {PRODUCT} VSCode extension without the {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is the preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for developing {PRODUCT} services. {PRODUCT} provides a https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[VSCode extension] that enables you to design Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 business processes and Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models directly in VSCode.

For convenience, you can install and launch the VSCode from the https://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-online/#/download[Business Modeler Hub] desktop application, along with all other available {PRODUCT} modelers.

However, if you need to enable the VSCode extension without the {PRODUCT} Business Modeler Hub, follow this procedure to download and install the VSCode extension manually.

.Prerequisites
* https://code.visualstudio.com/[VSCode] 1.43.0 or later is installed.

.Procedure
. In the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[`kogito-tooling`] releases page in GitHub, download the latest version of the `vscode_extension_{PRODUCT_INIT}_kie_editors___VERSION__.vsix` file.
. In your VSCode IDE, go to *Extensions* -> *More actions* -> *Install from VSIX* and select the downloaded extension file.
. When the {PRODUCT} extension appears in the extension list in VSCode, select it and click *Enable*, if needed.
. Close your instance of VSCode and re-launch VSCode from a command terminal with the following command and parameters:
+
--

$ code --enable-proposed-api kiegroup.vscode-extension-pack-kogito-kie-editors
----
.On Mac
[source]
----
$ code --args --enable-proposed-api kiegroup.vscode-extension-pack-kogito-kie-editors
----

Use this method to open VSCode each time you develop {PRODUCT} services. This set of parameters enables the Microsoft https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/using-proposed-api[Proposed API] for an optimal user experience with VSCode extensions.
--

After you enable this VSCode extension, any `.bpmn2` and `.dmn` files that you open in VSCode are automatically displayed as graphical models.

If the {PRODUCT} BPMN or DMN modelers open only the XML source of a BPMN or DMN file and displays an error message, review the reported errors and the model file to ensure that all BPMN or DMN elements are correctly defined.

NOTE: For new BPMN or DMN models, you can also enter `bpmn.new` or `dmn.new` in a web browser to design your BPMN or DMN model in the {PRODUCT} online modeler. When you finish creating your model, you can click *Download* in the online modeler page to import your BPMN or DMN file into your {PRODUCT} project in VSCode.

[id='proc-kogito-creating-project_{context}']
== Creating a Maven project for a {PRODUCT} service

Before you can begin developing {PRODUCT} services, you need to create a Maven project where you can build your {PRODUCT} assets and any other related resources for your application.

.Procedure
. In a command terminal, navigate to a local folder where you want to store the new {PRODUCT} project.
. Run the following command to generate a project within a defined folder:
+
--
.On Quarkus
[source]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie.kogito \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=kogito-quarkus-archetype \
    -DgroupId=org.acme -DartifactId=sample-kogito \
    -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
----
////
@comment: The following standard command for Quarkus isn't working currently but may be restored for Dev Preview

mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:create -DprojectGroupId=com.company -DprojectArtifactId=sample-kogito -Dextensions="kogito"

    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie.kogito \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=kogito-springboot-archetype \
    -DgroupId=org.acme -DartifactId=sample-kogito \
    -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

This command generates a `sample-kogito` Maven project and imports the {PRODUCT} extension for all required dependencies and configurations to prepare your application for business automation.
--
. Open or import the project in your VSCode IDE to view the contents.

[id='proc-kogito-designing-app_{context}']
== Designing the application logic for a {PRODUCT} service using DMN and BPMN

After you create your {PRODUCT} project, you can create or import Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 business processes, Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models, Drools Rule Language (DRL) business rules, XLS or XLSX decision tables, and other assets in the `src/main/resources` folder of your project. You can also include Java classes in the `src/main/java` folder of your project that act as Java services or that provide implementations that you call from your business processes or decisions.

The example for this procedure is a basic {PRODUCT} service that provides a REST endpoint `/persons`. This endpoint is automatically generated based on an example `PersonProcess.bpmn2` business process that employs an example `PersonDecisions.dmn` DMN model to make decisions based on the data being processed.

The business process contains the business logic of the {PRODUCT} service. The process provides the complete set of steps to achieve the business goal. The process is also the entry point to the service that can be consumed by other services.

The business decision contains the decision logic of the {PRODUCT} service. In this example, the decision logic is invoked as part of the business process. You can define business rules and decisions in several ways, such as with DMN models, DRL rules, or XLS or XLSX decision tables. The example for this procedure uses a DMN model.

.Procedure
. In the Maven project that you generated for your {PRODUCT} service, navigate to the `src/main/java/org/acme` folder and add the following `Person.java` file:
+
--
.Example person Java object
[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import java.io.Serializable;

public class Person {

	private String name;
	private int age;
	private boolean adult;

	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public int getAge() {
		return age;
	}

	public void setAge(int age) {
		this.age = age;
	}

	public boolean isAdult() {
		return adult;
	}

	public void setAdult(boolean adult) {
		this.adult = adult;
	}

	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "Person [name=" + name + ", age=" + age + ", adult=" + adult + "]";
	}

}
----
This example Java object sets and retrieves a person's name, age, and adult status.
--
. Navigate to the `src/main/resources` folder and add the following `PersonDecisions.dmn` DMN decision model:
+
--
.Example person DMN decision requirements diagram (DRD)
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-dmn-example-person.png[Image of person DMN decision diagram]

.Example DMN boxed expression for Is Adult decision
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-dmn-example-person-logic.png[Image of person DMN decision table]

.Example DMN data types
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-dmn-example-person-data-types.png[Image of person DMN data types]

This example DMN model consists of a basic DMN input node and a decision node defined by a DMN decision table with a custom structured data type.

In VSCode (recommended), you can add the {PRODUCT} https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[VSCode extension] to design the decision requirements diagram (DRD), boxed expression, and data types with the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler.

To create this example DMN model quickly, you can copy the following `PersonDecisions.dmn` file content:

To create this example DMN model in VSCode using the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler, follow these steps:

.. In the upper-right corner of the DMN modeler, click the *Properties* icon and confirm that the DMN model *Name* is set to `PersonDecisions`.
.. In the left palette, select *DMN Input Data*, drag the node to the canvas, and double-click the node to name it `Person`.
.. In the left palette, select *DMN Decision*, drag the node to the canvas, double-click the node to name it `isAdult`, and link to it from the input node.
.. Select the decision node to display the node options and click the *Edit* icon to open the DMN boxed expression editor to define the decision logic for the node.
.. Click the undefined expression field and select *Decision Table*.
.. Click the upper-left corner of the decision table to set the hit policy to *Unique*.
.. Set the input and output columns so that the input source `Person.Age` with type `number` determines the age limit and the output target `isAdult` with type `boolean` determines adult status:
+
.Example DMN decision table for `isAdult` decision
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-dmn-example-person-logic.png[Image of person DMN decision table]
.. In the upper tab options, select the *Data Types* tab and add the following `tPerson` structured data type and nested data types:
+
.Example DMN data types
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-dmn-example-person-data-types.png[Image of person DMN data types]
.. After you define the data types, select the *Editor* tab to return to the DMN modeler canvas.
.. Select the *Person* input node, click the *Properties* icon, and under *Information item*, set the *Data type* to `tPerson`.
.. Select the *isAdult* decision node, click the *Properties* icon, and under *Information item*, confirm that the *Data type* is still set to `boolean`. You previously set this data type when you created the decision table.
.. Save the DMN decision file.
--
. In the `src/main/resources` folder, add the following `PersonProcess.bpmn2` BPMN process model:
+
--
.Example person BPMN process
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-bpmn-example-person.png[Image of person process diagram]

This example process consists of the following basic BPMN components:

* Start event
* Business rule task
* Exclusive gateway
* User task
* End events

In VSCode (recommended), you can add the {PRODUCT} https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[VSCode extension] to model the business process with the {PRODUCT} BPMN modeler.

To create this example process quickly, you can copy the following `PersonProcess.bpmn2` file content:

=== Using DRL rule units as an alternative decision service

As an alternative to using Decision Model and Notation (DMN) to define this example decision service, you can also use a Drools Rule Language (DRL) file implemented as a rule unit.

A DRL rule unit is a module for rules and a unit of execution. A rule unit collects a set of rules with the declaration of the type of facts that the rules act on. A rule unit also serves as a unique namespace for each group of rules. A single rule base can contain multiple rule units. You typically store all the rules for a unit in the same file as the unit declaration so that the unit is self-contained. For more information about rule units, see
ifdef::KOGITO[]
{URL_DECISION_SERVICES}#con-drl-rule-units_drl-rules[_{DECISION_SERVICES}_].
endif::[]
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
xref:con-drl-rule-units_drl-rules[].
endif::[]

.Procedure
. In the `src/main/resources` folder of your example {PRODUCT} project, instead of using a DMN file, add the following `PersonRules.drl` file:
+
--
.Example person DRL file
[source]
----
package org.acme
unit PersonRules;

import org.acme.Person;

rule isAdult
	when
		$person: /person[ age > 18 ]
	then
    modify($person) {
    	setAdult(true)
    };
end
----

This example rule determines that any person who is older than 18 is classified as an adult. The rule file also declares that the rule belongs to the rule unit `PersonRules`. This is the rule unit that you define as part of the business rule task in the example BPMN process. When you build the project, the rule unit is generated and associated with the DRL file.

The rule also defines the condition using OOPath notation. OOPath is an object-oriented syntax extension to XPath for navigating through related elements while handling collections and filtering constraints.

You can also rewrite the same rule condition in a more explicit form using the traditional rule pattern syntax, as shown in the following example:

.Example person DRL file using traditional notation
[source]
----
package org.acme
unit PersonRules;

import org.acme.Person;

rule isAdult
	when
		$person: Person(age > 18) from person
	then
    modify($person) {
    	setAdult(true)
    };
end
----
--
. In the `src/main/resources` folder, use the {PRODUCT} BPMN modeler in VSCode to open the `PersonProcess.bpmn2` process diagram that you created.
. Select the `Evaluate person` business rule task and modify the following properties:

* *Implementation/Execution*: Set the following values:
** *Rule Language*: `DRL` (instead of `DMN`)
** *Rule Flow Group*: `unit:org.acme.PersonRules`
+
This rule unit syntax in the *Rule Flow Group* field specifies that you are using the `org.acme.PersonRules` rule unit instead of a traditional rule flow group. This is the rule unit that you referenced in the example DRL file. When you build the project, the business process implicitly declares the rule unit as part of the business rule task to execute the DRL file.
* *Data Assignments*: Open the assignment settings and change the data input *Name* to `person` (instead of `Person`). This accommodates the input variable syntax required by the DRL file.
. Select the connector that connects the exclusive gateway to the end event and for the *Implementation/Execution* property, verify that the *Condition Expression* is set to `Java` and change the condition to `return person.isAdult();`.
. Select the connector that connects the exclusive gateway to the user task and for the *Implementation/Execution* property, verify that the *Condition Expression* is set to `Java` and change the condition `return ! person.isAdult();`.
. Save the process file to update the model.

== Running a {PRODUCT} service

After you design the business decisions and processes for your {PRODUCT} service, you can run your Quarkus or Spring Boot application in one of the following modes:

* *Development mode*: For local testing. On Quarkus, development mode also offers live reload of your processes and decisions in your running applications for advanced debugging.
* *JVM mode*: For compatibility with a Java virtual machine (JVM).
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
* *Native mode*: (Quarkus only, requires GraalVM) For direct binary execution as native code.
endif::[]

.Procedure
In a command terminal, navigate to the project that contains your {PRODUCT} service and enter one of the following commands, depending on your preferred run mode and application environment:

* For development mode:
+
--
.On Quarkus
[source]
----
mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
----

.On Sprint Boot
[source]
----
mvn clean compile spring-boot:run
----

[id='proc-kogito-interacting-app_{context}']
== Interacting with a running {PRODUCT} service

After your {PRODUCT} service is running, you can send REST API requests to interact with your application and execute your services according to how you set up the application.

This example tests the `/persons` REST API endpoint that is automatically generated based on the `PersonProcess.bpmn2` business process, according to the decisions in the `PersonDecisions.dmn` file (or the rules in the `PersonRules.drl` file if you used a DRL rule unit).

For this example, use a REST client, curl utility, or the Swagger UI configured for the application at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/ to send API requests with the following components:

* *URL*: `\http://localhost:8080/persons`
* *HTTP headers*:
** `accept`: `application/json`
** `content-type`: `application/json`
* *HTTP methods*: `GET`, `POST`, or `DELETE`

This example procedure uses curl commands for convenience.

.Procedure
In a command terminal window that is separate from your running application, navigate to the project that contains your {PRODUCT} service and use any of the following curl commands with JSON requests to interact with your running service:

NOTE: On Spring Boot, you might need to modify how your application exposes API endpoints in order for these example requests to function. For more information, see the `README` file included in the example Spring Boot project that you created for this tutorial.
