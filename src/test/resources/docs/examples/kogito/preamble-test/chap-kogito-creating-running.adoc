== {PRODUCT} business automation

{PRODUCT} is a cloud-native business automation technology for building cloud-ready business applications. The name _Kogito_ derives from the Latin "Cogito", as in "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"), and is pronounced `[ˈkoː.d͡ʒi.to]` (_KO-jee-to_). The letter _K_ has reference to Kubernetes, the base for {OPENSHIFT} as the target cloud platform for {PRODUCT}, and to the Knowledge Is Everything (KIE) open source business automation project from which {PRODUCT} originates.

{PRODUCT} is designed specifically to excel in a hybrid cloud environment and to be adaptable to your domain and tooling needs. The core objective of {PRODUCT} is to help you mold a set of business processes and decisions into your own domain-specific cloud-native set of services.

.Business processes and decisions to cloud services
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-assets-to-cloud.png[Image of business assets moving to cloud services]

When you are using {PRODUCT}, you are building a cloud-native application as a set of independent domain-specific services, collaborating to achieve some business value. The processes and decisions that you use to describe the target behavior are executed as part of the services that you create. The resulting services are highly distributed and scalable with no centralized orchestration service, and the runtime that your service uses is optimized for what your service needs.

// @comment: Excluding for simplicity for now (Stetson, 18 Feb 2020)
//If you need long-lived processes, you can persist the runtime state externally in a data grid such as Infinispan. Each {PRODUCT} service also produces events that can be consumed by other services. For example, if you use Apache Kafka, events can be aggregated and indexed in a data index service, offering advanced query capabilities through GraphQL.

{PRODUCT} includes components that are based on well-known business automation KIE projects, specifically https://drools.org[Drools], https://jbpm.org[jBPM], and https://optaplanner.org[OptaPlanner], to offer dependable, open source solutions for business rules, business processes, and constraint solving.

=== Cloud-first priority

{PRODUCT} is designed to run and scale on a cloud infrastructure. You can use {PRODUCT} with the latest cloud-based technologies, such as Quarkus, Knative, and Apache Kafka, to get fast boot times and instant scaling on container application platforms, such as {OPENSHIFT}.

.Technologies used with {PRODUCT}
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-related-technolgies.png[Image of cloud-based technologies]

For example, {PRODUCT} is compatible with the following technologies:

* *{OPENSHIFT}*, based on Kubernetes, is the target platform for building and managing containerized applications.
* *Quarkus* is the new native Java stack for Kubernetes that you can use when you build applications with {PRODUCT} services.
* *Spring Boot* is also supported with {PRODUCT} if you need to use the Spring Framework with {PRODUCT}.
* *Knative* enables you to build serverless applications with {PRODUCT} that you can scale up or down (to zero) as needed.
* *Prometheus* and *Grafana* are compatible with {PRODUCT} services for monitoring and analytics with optional extensions.
* *Kafka*, *Infinispan*, and *Keycloak* are also some of the middleware technologies that {PRODUCT} supports for messaging, persistence, and security.
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
* *GraalVM* with Quarkus enables you to use native compilation with {PRODUCT}, resulting in fast start-up times and minimal footprint. For example, a native {PRODUCT} service starts in about 0.003ms, about 100 times faster than a non-native start-up. Fast start-up is almost a necessity in a cloud ecosystem, especially if you need small serverless applications.
endif::[]

=== Domain-specific flexibility

{PRODUCT} adapts to your business domain instead of forcing you to modify your domain to work with {PRODUCT}. You can expose your {PRODUCT} services with domain-specific APIs, based on the processes and decisions that you have defined. Domain-specific APIs for {PRODUCT} services do not require third-party or internal APIs.

For example, a process for onboarding employees could generate remote REST API endpoints that you can use to onboard new employees or get information on their status, all using domain-specific JSON data.

.Example custom API endpoints in Swagger
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-domain-api-endpoints-example.png[Image of REST API endpoints in Swagger UI]

You can also expose domain-specific data through events or in a data index so that the data can be consumed and queried by other services.

=== Developer-centered experience

Another focus of {PRODUCT} is optimal developer experience. You can use much or all of your existing tooling and workflow to develop, build, and deploy {PRODUCT} services, whether locally for testing or into the cloud. Quarkus offers development mode features to help with local testing, such as live reload of your processes and decisions in your running applications for advanced debugging.

{PRODUCT} tooling is embeddable so that you can continue using the worklfow you already use for cloud-native services. For example, the {PRODUCT} https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[VSCode extension] enables you to edit your Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 business processes and Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models directly in your VSCode IDE, next to your other application code.

.Building a {PRODUCT} process service in VSCode
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-run-quarkus-devmode-demo.gif[Demo of {PRODUCT} BPMN2 extension in VSCode]

To deploy your services into the cloud, you can use the {PRODUCT} Operator, which guides you through every step. The {PRODUCT} Operator uses the https://github.com/operator-framework[Operator Framework] to automate and manage many of the deployment steps for you. For example, when you give the operator a link to the Git repository that contains your application, the operator can automatically configure the components required to build your project from source and deploy the resulting services. {PRODUCT} also offers a command-line interface (CLI) to simplify some of these deployment tasks.

[id='con-kogito-quarkus-springboot_{context}']
=== {PRODUCT} on Quarkus and Spring Boot

The primary Java frameworks that {PRODUCT} supports are Quarkus (recommended) and Spring Boot.

https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] is a Kubernetes-native Java framework with a container-first approach to building Java applications, especially for Java virtual machines (JVMs) such as GraalVM and HotSpot. Quarkus optimizes Java specifically for Kubernetes by reducing the size of both the Java application and container image footprint, eliminating some of the Java programming workload from previous generations, and reducing the amount of memory required to run those images.

For {PRODUCT} services, Quarkus is the preferred framework for optimal Kubernetes compatibility and enhanced developer features, such as live reload in development mode for advanced debugging.

https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] is a Java-based framework for building standalone production-ready Spring applications. Spring Boot enables you to develop Spring applications with minimal configurations and without an entire Spring configuration setup.

For {PRODUCT} services, Spring Boot is supported for developers who need to use {PRODUCT} in an existing Spring Framework environment.

[id='ref-kogito-app-examples_{context}']
== Example applications with {PRODUCT} services

{PRODUCT} includes example applications in the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples[`kogito-examples`] repository in GitHub. These example applications contain various types of {PRODUCT} services on Quarkus or Spring Boot to help you develop your own applications. The services use one or more Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) process models, Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models, Drools Rule Language (DRL) rule units, XLS spreadsheet decision tables, or Java classes to define the service logic.

For information about each example application and instructions for using them, see the `README` file in the relevant application folder.

NOTE: In the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples[`{PRODUCT_INIT}-examples`] repository in GitHub, the example applications in the default `stable` branch use the latest version of {PRODUCT}.

The following list describes some of the examples provided with {PRODUCT}:

* `dmn-quarkus-example` and `dmn-springboot-example`: A decision service (on Quarkus or Spring Boot) that uses DMN to determine driver penalty and suspension based on traffic violations
* `rules-quarkus-helloworld`: A Hello World decision service on Quarkus with a single DRL rule unit
* `ruleunit-quarkus-example` and `ruleunit-springboot-example`: A decision service (on Quarkus or Spring Boot) that uses DRL with rule units to validate a loan application and that exposes REST operations to view application status
* `process-quarkus-helloworld`: A Hello World process service on Quarkus with a single BPMN model
* `process-quarkus-example` and `process-springboot-example`: A process service (on Quarkus or Spring Boot) for ordering items and that exposes REST operations to create new orders or to list and delete active orders
* `onboarding-example`: A combination of a process service and two decision services that use DMN and DRL for onboarding new employees
* `kogito-travel-agency`: A combination of process services and decision services that use DRL and XLS for travel booking, intended for deployment on {OPENSHIFT}
// end::ref-kogito-app-examples[]

[id='proc-kogito-app-examples-running_{context}']
=== Running the {PRODUCT} example applications

To get started quickly with {PRODUCT}, you can run any of the example applications in the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples[`kogito-examples`] repository in GitHub and experiment with the {PRODUCT} services.

For this procedure, use the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-quarkus-example[`process-quarkus-example`] or https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-springboot-example[`process-springboot-example`] application. You can follow similar steps with the other {PRODUCT} examples on Quarkus or Spring Boot.

In the `process-quarkus-example` and `process-springboot-example` applications, the `orders.bpmn2` process describes the steps that need to be followed when ordering items. The process includes a script task for writing debug information and a call activity for invoking a subprocess, using a custom `Order` data object.

.Example `orders.bpmn2` process
image::kogito/creating-running/bpmn-model-example-orders.png[Image of `orders.bpmn` example process]

The `Add items` subprocess invokes the following `orderItems.bpmn2` process, which uses a `CalculationService.calculateTotal` custom Java service and a user task to verify the order.

.Example `orderItems.bpmn2` process invoked as a subprocess
image::kogito/creating-running/bpmn-model-example-order-items.png[Image of `orderItems.bpmn` example process]

The `persons.bpmn2` process invokes a Drools Rule Languge (DRL) rule unit in a business rule task to determine customer age, followed by a user task for special handling requirements for children, if applicable.

.Example `persons.bpmn2` process invoked as a subprocess
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-bpmn-example-person.png[Image of `persons` process diagram]

Based on these processes and on application configurations, this example service exposes REST operations to create new orders, to list and delete active orders, and to determine the age of a specified person.

.Procedure
. Download the latest https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/releases[`kogito-examples`] release to a local directory and extract the file.
. In a command terminal, navigate to the extracted `kogito-examples-__RELEASE__/process-__PLATFORM__-example` folder, and enter one of the following commands to build and run the example.

[id='proc-kogito-designing-app_{context}']
== Designing the application logic for a {PRODUCT} service using DMN and BPMN

After you create your {PRODUCT} project, you can create or import Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 business processes, Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models, Drools Rule Language (DRL) business rules, XLS or XLSX decision tables, and other assets in the `src/main/resources` folder of your project. You can also include Java classes in the `src/main/java` folder of your project that act as Java services or that provide implementations that you call from your business processes or decisions.

The example for this procedure is a basic {PRODUCT} service that provides a REST endpoint `/persons`. This endpoint is automatically generated based on an example `PersonProcess.bpmn2` business process that employs an example `PersonDecisions.dmn` DMN model to make decisions based on the data being processed.

The business process contains the business logic of the {PRODUCT} service. The process provides the complete set of steps to achieve the business goal. The process is also the entry point to the service that can be consumed by other services.

The business decision contains the decision logic of the {PRODUCT} service. In this example, the decision logic is invoked as part of the business process. You can define business rules and decisions in several ways, such as with DMN models, DRL rules, or XLS or XLSX decision tables. The example for this procedure uses a DMN model.

.Procedure
. In the Maven project that you generated for your {PRODUCT} service, navigate to the `src/main/java/org/acme` folder and add the following `Person.java` file:
+
--
.Example person Java object
[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import java.io.Serializable;

public class Person {

	private String name;
	private int age;
	private boolean adult;

	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public int getAge() {
		return age;
	}

	public void setAge(int age) {
		this.age = age;
	}

	public boolean isAdult() {
		return adult;
	}

	public void setAdult(boolean adult) {
		this.adult = adult;
	}

	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "Person [name=" + name + ", age=" + age + ", adult=" + adult + "]";
	}

}
----
This example Java object sets and retrieves a person's name, age, and adult status.
--
. Navigate to the `src/main/resources` folder and add the following `PersonDecisions.dmn` DMN decision model:
+
--
.Example person DMN decision requirements diagram (DRD)
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-dmn-example-person.png[Image of person DMN decision diagram]

.Example DMN boxed expression for Is Adult decision

.Example DMN data types
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-dmn-example-person-data-types.png[Image of person DMN data types]

This example DMN model consists of a basic DMN input node and a decision node defined by a DMN decision table with a custom structured data type.

In VSCode (recommended), you can add the {PRODUCT} https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[VSCode extension] to design the decision requirements diagram (DRD), boxed expression, and data types with the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler.

To create this example DMN model quickly, you can copy the following `PersonDecisions.dmn` file content:

To create this example DMN model in VSCode using the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler, follow these steps:

.. In the upper-right corner of the DMN modeler, click the *Properties* icon and confirm that the DMN model *Name* is set to `PersonDecisions`.
.. In the left palette, select *DMN Input Data*, drag the node to the canvas, and double-click the node to name it `Person`.
.. In the left palette, select *DMN Decision*, drag the node to the canvas, double-click the node to name it `isAdult`, and link to it from the input node.
.. Select the decision node to display the node options and click the *Edit* icon to open the DMN boxed expression editor to define the decision logic for the node.
.. Click the undefined expression field and select *Decision Table*.
.. Click the upper-left corner of the decision table to set the hit policy to *Unique*.
.. Set the input and output columns so that the input source `Person.Age` with type `number` determines the age limit and the output target `isAdult` with type `boolean` determines adult status:
+
.Example DMN decision table for `isAdult` decision
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-dmn-example-person-logic.png[Image of person DMN decision table]
.. In the upper tab options, select the *Data Types* tab and add the following `tPerson` structured data type and nested data types:
+
.Example DMN data types
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-dmn-example-person-data-types.png[Image of person DMN data types]
.. After you define the data types, select the *Editor* tab to return to the DMN modeler canvas.
.. Select the *Person* input node, click the *Properties* icon, and under *Information item*, set the *Data type* to `tPerson`.
.. Select the *isAdult* decision node, click the *Properties* icon, and under *Information item*, confirm that the *Data type* is still set to `boolean`. You previously set this data type when you created the decision table.
.. Save the DMN decision file.
--
. In the `src/main/resources` folder, add the following `PersonProcess.bpmn2` BPMN process model:
+
--
.Example person BPMN process
image::kogito/creating-running/kogito-bpmn-example-person.png[Image of person process diagram]

This example process consists of the following basic BPMN components:

* Start event
* Business rule task
* Exclusive gateway
* User task
* End events

In VSCode (recommended), you can add the {PRODUCT} https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[VSCode extension] to model the business process with the {PRODUCT} BPMN modeler.

To create this example process quickly, you can copy the following `PersonProcess.bpmn2` file content:

=== Using DRL rule units as an alternative decision service

As an alternative to using Decision Model and Notation (DMN) to define this example decision service, you can also use a Drools Rule Language (DRL) file implemented as a rule unit.

A DRL rule unit is a module for rules and a unit of execution. A rule unit collects a set of rules with the declaration of the type of facts that the rules act on. A rule unit also serves as a unique namespace for each group of rules. A single rule base can contain multiple rule units. You typically store all the rules for a unit in the same file as the unit declaration so that the unit is self-contained. For more information about rule units, see
ifdef::KOGITO-ENT[]
{URL_DECISION_SERVICES}#con-drl-rule-units_drl-rules[_{DECISION_SERVICES}_].
endif::[]
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
xref:con-drl-rule-units_drl-rules[].
endif::[]

.Procedure
. In the `src/main/resources` folder of your example {PRODUCT} project, instead of using a DMN file, add the following `PersonRules.drl` file:
+
--
.Example person DRL file
[source]
----
package org.acme
unit PersonRules;

import org.acme.Person;

rule isAdult
	when
		$person: /person[ age > 18 ]
	then
    modify($person) {
    	setAdult(true)
    };
end
----

This example rule determines that any person who is older than 18 is classified as an adult. The rule file also declares that the rule belongs to the rule unit `PersonRules`. This is the rule unit that you define as part of the business rule task in the example BPMN process. When you build the project, the rule unit is generated and associated with the DRL file.

The rule also defines the condition using OOPath notation. OOPath is an object-oriented syntax extension to XPath for navigating through related elements while handling collections and filtering constraints.

You can also rewrite the same rule condition in a more explicit form using the traditional rule pattern syntax, as shown in the following example:

.Example person DRL file using traditional notation
[source]
----
package org.acme
unit PersonRules;

import org.acme.Person;

rule isAdult
	when
		$person: Person(age > 18) from person
	then
    modify($person) {
    	setAdult(true)
    };
end
----
--
. In the `src/main/resources` folder, use the {PRODUCT} BPMN modeler in VSCode to open the `PersonProcess.bpmn2` process diagram that you created.
. Select the `Evaluate person` business rule task and modify the following properties:

* *Implementation/Execution*: Set the following values:
** *Rule Language*: `DRL` (instead of `DMN`)
** *Rule Flow Group*: `unit:org.acme.PersonRules`
+
This rule unit syntax in the *Rule Flow Group* field specifies that you are using the `org.acme.PersonRules` rule unit instead of a traditional rule flow group. This is the rule unit that you referenced in the example DRL file. When you build the project, the business process implicitly declares the rule unit as part of the business rule task to execute the DRL file.
* *Data Assignments*: Open the assignment settings and change the data input *Name* to `person` (instead of `Person`). This accommodates the input variable syntax required by the DRL file.
. Select the connector that connects the exclusive gateway to the end event and for the *Implementation/Execution* property, verify that the *Condition Expression* is set to `Java` and change the condition to `return person.isAdult();`.
. Select the connector that connects the exclusive gateway to the user task and for the *Implementation/Execution* property, verify that the *Condition Expression* is set to `Java` and change the condition `return ! person.isAdult();`.
. Save the process file to update the model.

== Running a {PRODUCT} service

After you design the business decisions and processes for your {PRODUCT} service, you can run your Quarkus or Spring Boot application in one of the following modes:

* *Development mode*: For local testing. On Quarkus, development mode also offers live reload of your processes and decisions in your running applications for advanced debugging.
* *JVM mode*: For compatibility with a Java virtual machine (JVM).
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
* *Native mode*: (Quarkus only, requires GraalVM) For direct binary execution as native code.
endif::[]

.Procedure
In a command terminal, navigate to the project that contains your {PRODUCT} service and enter one of the following commands, depending on your preferred run mode and application environment:

* For development mode:
+
--
.On Quarkus
[source]
----
mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
----

.On Sprint Boot
[source]
----
mvn clean compile spring-boot:run
----

[id='proc-kogito-interacting-app_{context}']
== Interacting with a running {PRODUCT} service

After your {PRODUCT} service is running, you can send REST API requests to interact with your application and execute your services according to how you set up the application.

This example tests the `/persons` REST API endpoint that is automatically generated based on the `PersonProcess.bpmn2` business process, according to the decisions in the `PersonDecisions.dmn` file (or the rules in the `PersonRules.drl` file if you used a DRL rule unit).

For this example, use a REST client, curl utility, or the Swagger UI configured for the application at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/ to send API requests with the following components:

* *URL*: `\http://localhost:8080/persons`
* *HTTP headers*:
** `accept`: `application/json`
** `content-type`: `application/json`
* *HTTP methods*: `GET`, `POST`, or `DELETE`

This example procedure uses curl commands for convenience.

.Procedure
In a command terminal window that is separate from your running application, navigate to the project that contains your {PRODUCT} service and use any of the following curl commands with JSON requests to interact with your running service:

NOTE: On Spring Boot, you might need to modify how your application exposes API endpoints in order for these example requests to function. For more information, see the `README` file included in the example Spring Boot project that you created for this tutorial.

An extension required to generate and build a Maven project for {PRODUCT} runtime services on the Quarkus Java framework. You can add the {PRODUCT} extension during project creation using the Quarkus Maven plugin or using the https://code.quarkus.io/[Code with Quarkus] extension manager.
////

{PRODUCT} Data Index Service::
A dedicated service in {PRODUCT} that stores all {PRODUCT} events related to processes, tasks, and domain data. The Data Index Service uses Apache Kafka messaging to consume CloudEvents messages from {PRODUCT} services, and then indexes the returned data for future GraphQL queries and stores the data in the Infinispan persistence store. The Data Index Service is at the core of all {PRODUCT} search, insight, and management capabilities.

{PRODUCT} domain-specific service::
A business automation service for your business domain that you create using {PRODUCT}. You define the logic of this service using BPMN process models, DMN decision models, or other business models, and any other supported runtime configurations. In {PRODUCT} documentation, the general term for _{PRODUCT} services_ that you create refers to this type of service.

{PRODUCT} Jobs Service::
A dedicated service in {PRODUCT} for scheduling BPMN process events that are configured to be executed at a specified time. These time-based events in a process model are known as _jobs_. The Jobs Service does not execute a job, but triggers a callback that might be an HTTP request on a given endpoint specified for the job request or any other configured callback. The Jobs Service receives requests for job scheduling and then sends a request at the time specified on the job request.

unit of work::
A component in {PRODUCT} that serves as the basis for {PRODUCT} runtime execution. Units of work capture all steps in a process and are used internally to move a process instance from one state to the next state. After all possible steps in a process are successfully executed, the final state is sent to the {PRODUCT} runtime as a runtime event. {PRODUCT} can then use these events to notify third parties about changes to the BPMN process instance and its data.
