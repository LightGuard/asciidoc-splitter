= Some new Document

Now we have some extra content here.

There is another paragraph here.

[replace-with="new-doc.adoc" replace-with-id="hello-world"]
link:{asciidoc-dir}/new-doc.adoc[See this section for more info].

We'll add one more paragraph just to make sure this works in the middle of the file.
